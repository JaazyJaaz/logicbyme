/*
 * EE490 Homework/ project #2
 * Due : Septermber 13, 2018 at 8am
 * 
 * 2. Write Arduino code to blink an LED on digital pin 12 at a frequency of 10Hz
 *    a. what hardware do you need to connect to the arduino to 
 *       make this circuit work?
 *    b. Add the needed hardware. 
 *    c. compile and verify the code.
 *    d. download the code to your Arduino.
 *    e. send a video of your completed project tp your instructor
 *       or you can demonstrate it in person.

// assigns variables

  led_state = digitalRead(led_pin);                         // saves the new state of the led
